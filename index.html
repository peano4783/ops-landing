    <h2>Petr Novikov</h2>

    </p>


    <h3>How do I work</h3>
    <p>My work normally has the following stages:
    <ol>
        <li>Identify the problem and give the problem a proper set-up</li>
        <li>Find the solution and provide an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</li>
        <li>Transfer the knowledge to the customer's team</li>
        <li>Support and consulting for the customer's team when developing a full-scale product</li>
        <li>Now that the team has the necessary expertise and doesn't need me any more,
        I can switch to my next project.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Who's in my team</h3>
    <p>My experience shows that most of the talent and expertise I need for my work can be
    found among the customer's current employees. In case we need some additional staff,
    my highly skilled friends at Grid Dynamics are always there to help us.</p>

    <h3>Hiring me full-time</h3>
    <p>Of course, you can hire me to work for your company for a limited term. I will be acting
    just like your full-time employee, I will be attending your office and/or Zoom meetings if necessary.
    Please note that I will still maintain my status as a Grid Dynamics employee. </p>

    <h3>My salary expectations</h3>
    <p>This is negotiable, but please keep in mind that people like me are rare and are in high demand.</p>

    <h3>Relocation options</h3>
    <p>If necessary, I can physically relocate to the customer's site. Grid Dynamics
    can take care of all the necessary formalities for my relocation, including work visas.</p>

    <h3>What's Grid Dynamics</h3>
    <p>Grid Dynamics is a San Ramon, CA-based service company and my permanent employer.
