# Research plan

This all must be done through networking, virtual and offline,
not through some websites.

### What must be mentioned:

- I worked in Sequential testing
  
- The most popular test is SPRT
  
- We found a test that is better than the SPRT

- People are reluctant to accept our test in practice, because it's usability
is poor compared to that of SPRT.
  
- We must make our test usable. It would be good if we make an R or Python package
that wraps our test and makes them as usable as SPRT.
  
- I have solid experience in industry-level Data Science (including working for
  the Manufacturing division in A); I know what industry Data Scientist expect
  from the packages.
  
- Will be using Bachelors, Masters and PhD students as a workforce.

- We shall both have publications and OpenSource code.

- Good for them for future employment, they will be able to show their contribution to something
that will go to the industry. They will have an actual portfolio.
